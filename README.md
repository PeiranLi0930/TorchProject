# Paper Replication Repo
- This repo includes detailed replications of popular computer vision papers with exhaustive 
  annotations. 
- All the codes in this project is written by Pytorch. 
  
    - New to Pytorch? [See Your First Pytorch Tutor](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
    - [The second best place to learn Pytorch](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)
- Important architectures and mechanisms in Machine Learning and Deep Learning are included and 
  well annotated.

### Appreciations

- The [Holy Land](https://www.wisc.edu/) giving me best working environments
- My first Pytorch tutor: [Daniel Bourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke), the creater of [Zero to 
  Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)
- Significant Guiders on my path to Machine Learning and Deep Learning: [Robert Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/)
  , [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/), [Feifei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li)
  , [Sharon Zhou](https://sharonzhou.me/), [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/)
- I wish to express my boundless gratitude to Professor Vikas Singh. I appreciate him enduring my incessant ignorance, offering me ample patience and tolerance. He is a vital guide on my academic journey.
